                        <p>
                        The YMCA-RGE has set up a youth camp together with YMCA Paris called “Camp Climate”,
                        where we estimate to provide housing for 100 YMCA youth and 100 non-YMCA participants.
                        The Camp’s idea is to ensure youth participation to COP21. There will be various
                        activities available for camp participants to take part in if desired. The scehduled for
                        these will be announced soon, but we know that it will involve participating in
                        demonstrations, attending different social events hosted by NGOs from all over the world
                        and being an active part of the civil society.
                        </p>
                        <p>        
                        You will be able to stay at the camp in two different periods, week 1 (November 30
                        - December 6) &amp; week 2 (December 6 - 12). Of course you are also welcome to stay for the two
                        periods. You will stay in shared rooms with three beds and breakfast is included. The price per
                        week will be 120 EUR (20 EUR/Night). The rest of the cost for the camp is subsidised by the YMCA
                        World Alliance. Right now we are looking into the possibility of staying at the Camp Climate
                        site ahead of and after the official conference dates.

                                partake at Camp Climate, for the period that you are staying in Paris as a YMCA-RGE

                        Note: By the 30th of august you will be required to have contacted your national YMCA
                        to be able to get housing at Camp Climate during your stay in Paris. If your national YMCA is
                        not sending people to Camp Climate you should contact WG-leaders (Oscar &amp; Petter).
