                        If you're reading this, you're already doing more than most. You are seriously considering
                        taking two whole weeks, and countless more hours before those weeks, from your life and put them
                        to work to ensure that both we ourselves and future generations of humanity have a working
                        planet to live, work, and play on. You are seriously considering spending a non-negligible sum
                        of money on getting to and from Paris. You are seriously considering joining the small but
                        growing team of YMCA #climateheroes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        When we first joined the RGE and decided to go to our first COP conferences, we weren't really
                        sure what lay ahead. We didn't know what was expected from us, we didn't know what to expect
                        from our colleagues in the YMCA, and we didn't know what to expect from the events we attended.
                        To make sure you don't feel the same way, and instead get the chance to make a well informed
                        decision, we decided to create this guide to the Working Group on COP, everything that will
                        happen in Paris, and all the practicalities you need to think of. After going through it,
                        reading carefully, you'll be presented with the signup form for joining the group.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Best regards,<br>
                        Oscar and Petter<br>
                        Working group coordinators
