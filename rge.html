                            About the YMCA-RGE and WGCOP
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                                The YMCA-RGE has been dedicated to tracking the process of the United Nations Climate
                                Change Conferences or as we call it the Conference of the Parties (COP) since 2012. This
                                was the year that the YMCA-RGE took over responsibility of attending the UN-Conferences
                                from YMCA-Sweden which had sent delegations to COP since 2009.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                As the YMCA-RGE grew it formed a specific Working Group on COP (after COP19 in Warsaw
                                2013), which is now responsible for the YMCA’s involvement at the yearly Climate Change
                                Conferences. This year 2015, is particularly important as all nations have agreed
                                upon signing what is to become a New Global Climate Agreement in Paris this December.
                                For this agreement to be successful Civil Society needs to mobilize, track and lobby the
                                negotiations to make sure that the agenda of Big Polluters won’t impose on individual’s
                                right to a liveable future.
                        </p>
                        <h2>History of YMCA-RGE’s work on Empowering Youth in Environmental matters</h2>
                        <p>
                        The YMCA-RGE was formed at the RIO+20 Earth Summit in 2012 and has been active in shaping the greater environmental
                        agenda of the World YMCA since then. We have participated in the YMCA-World Challenge, the YMCA European Youth Festival
                        in Prague in 2013 and the YMCA World Council in Colorado in 2014. The YMCA-RGE have also worked towards empowering the
                        rights of young and future generations through a delegation of accredited youth delegates at COP18 in Doha, COP19 in
                        Warsaw and COP20 in Lima. In relation to COP20 in Lima 2014 the YMCA-RGE hosted the first ever Y-Summit on the
                        Environment together with YMCA-Peru. Participants of the Y-Summit represented 15 countries from across the globe. During
                        COP20 the YMCA-RGE introduced a concept of an Inside and an Outside group. The Inside group followed the negotiations
                        inside the Conference centre, whilst the the Outside group joined the rest of Civil Society in events and climate
                        marches in and around Lima. </p>
