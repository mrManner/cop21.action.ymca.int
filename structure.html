                                Structure of the RGE and WGCOP
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                                The YMCA-RGE is the environmental platform within the World Alliance of YMCA’s, which is
                                the umbrella organization for all national YMCA-movements. Within the YMCA-RGE there
                                are currently three active working groups, the Working Group on Environmental
                                Initiatives (bridging environmental action of YMCAs from all over the world), the
                                Working Group on Paris (hosting Camp Climate among other things), and the Working Group on
                                the Conference of the Parties. The WGCOP is currently led by two WG-Leaders called Oscar
                                Villacorta (Peru) and Petter Bjersér (Sweden) and is consisting of four WG-Teams,
                                Activism, Policy, Communications and Finance. 
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                            The Activism Team is led by Karin Edstedt (Sweden) with the focus on creating
                                            effective actions online and onsite in Paris to raise the climate ambition. The
                                            Activism Team is then responsible for setting up the Activism Group which will
                                            attend COP21.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                            The Policy Team is led by Jail Ixel (Mexico) with the focus on keeping track
                                            of all matters related to the negotiations and all ways the YMCA can
                                            influence the negotiations through our own lobbying, policies &amp; advocacy.
                                            The Policy Team is then responsible for setting up the Policy Group which
                                            will attend COP21.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                            The Communications Team is led by Johan Manner (Sweden) with the focus of
                                            communicating with the greater YMCA, international media and creating
                                            communications strategies on social media. The Communications Team is then
                                            responsible for setting up the Communications Group which will attend COP21.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                            The Finance Team is led by Eugene Mel (Cameroon) with focus of acquiring
                                            financing for WG-Members. This Team is the most important when it comes to
                                            making the YMCA-RGE into the global movement that the YMCA already is. To
                                            acquire financial resources is something that is vital to strive for
                                            equitable participation. This Team is not represented by a specific group in
                                            the conference, but members of this Team will have a high priority when it
                                            comes to receiving accreditations and improving the grand movement that we
                                            want to become.
